      <h2>General / Introduction</h2>
      <p>Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection provisions of the Swiss
        Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG), every person has the right to protection of their privacy as well as
        protection against misuse of their personal data. The operators of these pages take the protection of your
        personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data
        protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.<br /><br />In cooperation with our hosting providers, we
        make every effort to protect the databases as well as possible against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or
        falsification.<br /><br />We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication
        by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
        possible.<br /><br />By using this website, you consent to the collection, processing and use of data in
        accordance with the following description. This website can generally be visited without registration. Data such
        as pages accessed or names of files accessed, date and time are stored on the server for statistical purposes
        without this data being directly related to your person. Personal data, in particular name, address or e-mail
        address are collected as far as possible on a voluntary basis. Without your consent, the data will not be passed
        on to third parties.</p><br /><br />
      <h2>Processing of personal data</h2>
      <p>Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable person. A data subject is a
        person about whom personal data is processed. Processing includes any handling of personal data, regardless of
        the means and procedures used, in particular the storage, disclosure, acquisition, deletion, storage,
        modification, destruction and use of personal data.<br /><br />We process personal data in accordance with Swiss
        data protection law. Furthermore, to the extent and insofar as the EU GDPR is applicable, we process personal
        data in accordance with the following legal bases in connection with Art. 6 (1) GDPR:<br />lit. a) Processing of
        personal data with the consent of the data subject.<br />lit. b) Processing of personal data for the fulfillment
        of a contract with the data subject as well as for the implementation of corresponding pre-contractual
        measures.<br />lit. c) Processing of personal data for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which we are
        subject under any applicable law of the EU or under any applicable law of a country in which the GDPR is
        applicable in whole or in part.<br />lit. d) Processing of personal data in order to protect the vital interests
        of the data subject or another natural person.<br />lit. f) Processing of personal data to protect the
        legitimate interests of us or of third parties, unless the fundamental freedoms and rights and interests of the
        data subject are overridden. Legitimate interests include, in particular, our business interest in being able to
        provide our website, information security, the enforcement of our own legal claims and compliance with Swiss
        law.<br /><br />We process personal data for the duration required for the respective purpose or purposes. In
        the case of longer-term retention obligations due to legal and other obligations to which we are subject, we
        restrict processing accordingly.</p><br /><br />
      <h2>With SSL/TLS encryption</h2>
      <p>This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
        content, such as requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by
        the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in
        your browser line.<br /><br />If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read
        by third parties.</p><br /><br />
      <h2>Server Log-Files</h2>
      <p>The provider of this website automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which
        your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:<br />Browser type and Browser version<br />Operating
        system used<br />referrer URL<br />Host name of the accessing computer<br />Time of the server
        request<br /><br />This data cannot be assigned to specific persons. This data is not merged with other data
        sources. We reserve the right to check this data retrospectively if we become aware of specific indications of
        illegal use.</p><br /><br />
      <h2>Third party services</h2>
      <p>This website may use Google Maps for embedding maps, Google Invisible reCAPTCHA for protection against bots and
        spam, and YouTube for embedding videos.<br /><br />These services of the American Google LLC use cookies, among
        other things, and as a result, data is transferred to Google in the USA, although we assume that no personal
        tracking takes place in this context solely through the use of our website.<br /><br />Google has undertaken to
        ensure adequate data protection in accordance with the US-European and the US-Swiss Privacy
        Shield.<br /><br />Further information can be found in Google's privacy policy.</p><br /><br />
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>For the comment function on this website, in addition to your comment, details of when the comment was created,
        your e-mail address and, if you do not post anonymously, the username you have chosen will be
        stored.<br /><br />Storage of the IP address<br />Our comment function stores the IP addresses of users who post
        comments. Since we do not check comments on our site before they are activated, we need this data to be able to
        take action against the author in the event of legal violations such as insults or
        propaganda.<br /><br />Subscribing to comments<br />As a user of the site, you can subscribe to comments after
        registering. You will receive a confirmation email to verify that you are the owner of the email address
        provided. You can unsubscribe from this feature at any time via a link in the info emails.</p><br /><br />

        been transferred to a third country or to an international organization. If this is the case, the data subject
        also has the right to obtain information about the appropriate safeguards in connection with the

        officer at any time.<br /><br />Right to rectification<br />Every person affected by the processing of personal

        instead the restriction of the use of the personal data<br />The controller no longer needs the personal data

        legal claims<br />The data subject has objected to the processing on grounds relating to his or her particular
        situation, and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate interests of the controller override those of the data

        subject has the right to obtain that the personal data be transferred directly from one controller to another
        controller, insofar as this is technically feasible and insofar as this does not adversely affect the rights and

      <h2>Copyrights</h2>
      <p>The copyright and all other rights to the content, images, photos or other files on the website belong
        exclusively to the operator of this website or the specifically named copyright holders. For the reproduction of
        all files, the written consent of the copyright holder must be obtained in advance.<br />Anyone who commits a
        copyright infringement without the consent of the respective copyright holder may be liable to prosecution and
        possibly to damages.</p><br /><br />
      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>All information on our website has been carefully checked. We make every effort to ensure that the information
        we provide is up-to-date, correct and complete. Nevertheless, the occurrence of errors can not be completely
        excluded, so we can not guarantee the completeness, accuracy and timeliness of information, including
        journalistic-editorial nature. Liability claims regarding damage caused by the use of any information provided,
        including any kind of information which is incomplete or incorrect, will therefore be rejected.<br />The
        publisher may change or delete texts at his own discretion and without notice and is not obliged to update the
        contents of this website. The use of or access to this website is at the visitor's own risk. The publisher, its
        clients or partners are not responsible for damages, such as direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or
        punitive damages, allegedly caused by the visit of this website and consequently assume no liability for such
        damages.<br />The publisher also accepts no responsibility or liability for the content and availability of
        third-party websites that can be accessed via external links on this website. The operators of the linked sites
        are solely responsible for their content. The publisher thus expressly distances itself from all third-party
        content that may be relevant under criminal or liability law or that may offend common decency.</p><br /><br />
      <h2>Data transfer to the USA</h2>
      <p>Among other things, tools from companies based in the USA are integrated on our website. If these tools are
        active, your personal data may be transferred to the US servers of the respective companies. We would like to
        point out that the USA is not a safe third country in the sense of EU data protection law. US companies are
        obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take
        legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. intelligence services)
        process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no
        influence on these processing activities.</p><br /><br />
      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>We may amend this privacy policy at any time without prior notice. The current version published on our website
        applies. Insofar as the data protection declaration is part of an agreement with you, we will inform you of the
        change by e-mail or other suitable means in the event of an update.</p>
